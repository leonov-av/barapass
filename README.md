Simple password manager

Why not use a ready-made password manager? (thousands of them)
IMHO, itâ€™s very hard to control how password managers store the passwords and often very unpleasant vulnerabilities appear in them. I have everything in one small python file: a simple CLI, and functions for encryption/decryption. Itâ€™s only 200 lines.

Currently, barapass stores passwords encrypted using AES, but you can easily change it to any other cryptographic algorithm or a combination of them and use various methods to generate the keys. This customization can make it more secure in practical sense just because your passwords should be VERY interesting for the attacker to make this charades solving worth it. ðŸ™‚

The password for test encrypted container testcred.brp is "password123". Don't use such simple passwords in real life! ðŸ˜‰
